The application will run in any order but I suggest going through it in the following order for clarity;

- On dashboard select New Form and follow it until you reach the completion page.

- After forms have been filled, while still using the system and going to the dashboard, 
  or by logging back in and being put at the dashboard you will be able to view service requests 

Thank You!
